Update code to include the following labels for the hazard types

Emergent Groundwater = Emergent
Tidal Inundation, Emergent Groundwater = SLR + Storm Surge + Emergent
Tidal Inundation with Storm Surge, Very Shallow Groundwater (0-3 ft below ground) = Storm Surge + Very Shallow
Tidal Inundation with Storm Surge, Shallow Groundwater (3-6 ft below ground) = Storm Surge + Shallow
Tidal Inundation with Storm Surge, Moderately Shallow Groundwater (6-9 ft below ground) = Storm Surge + Moderately Shallow
Tidal Inundation with Storm Surge, Emergent Groundwater = Storm Surge + Emergent
Tidal Inundation with Storm Surge = Storm Surge
Very Shallow Groundwater (0-3 ft below ground) = Very Shallow
Shallow Groundwater (3-6 ft below ground) = Shallow
Moderately Shallow Groundwater (6-9 ft below ground) = Moderately Shallow
Existing Bay = Existing Bay
